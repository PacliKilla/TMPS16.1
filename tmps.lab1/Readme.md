#  Prerequisites:

- Design patterns
- Creational design patterns
- Structure the project using design patterns

## Objectives:

- Study creational design patterns
- Develop a project using 5 creational design patterns
- Ensure connection between patterns

## Tasks:

- Create an application using at least 3 design creational patterns :
   - Builder
   - Abstract Factory
   - Factory
   - Singleton
   - Prototype

##  Implementation of task:

Before starting performing this laboratory work I have studied about design patterns and what is the purpose of usign them into some projects, what are advantages. Also, I have studied each design pattern and I have tried to understand how it works.

## Builder pattern

It is creational design pattern which operate with creating the complex objects and we need to use when the process involved in creating an object is extremely complex, with lots of mandatory and optional parameters.

## Abstract Factory

Abstract Factory Pattern says that just define an interface or abstract class for creating families of related (or dependent) objects but without specifying their concrete sub-classes.That means Abstract Factory lets a class returns a factory of classes.
